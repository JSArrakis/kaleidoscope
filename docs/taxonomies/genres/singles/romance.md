# Romance

Romance is focused on the emotional journey of intimate relationships, exploring the development, challenges, and evolution of romantic connections between characters. Stripped down to its core elements, it emphasizes the emotional landscape of love, attraction, and interpersonal bonds, creating a deeply personal experience for the audience.

## Core Elements of Romance:

### Relationship as Central Conflict:

The central focus of Romance is the romantic relationship itself - its formation, development, obstacles, and resolution. Unlike other genres where romance serves as a subplot, here the relationship dynamics drive the entire narrative structure.

### Emotional Intimacy and Vulnerability:

Romance delves deeply into the emotional states of characters as they navigate attraction, connection, and intimacy. The genre explores vulnerability, trust, and the psychological aspects of falling in love or maintaining relationships.

### Character-Driven Narrative:

The plot serves primarily to explore character emotions and relationship dynamics rather than external events. The story unfolds through interactions, conversations, and shared experiences that reveal the depth of the romantic connection.

### Internal Conflict and Growth:

Much of the tension in Romance comes from internal struggles - fear of commitment, past traumas affecting relationships, or personal growth needed to sustain love. Characters must overcome emotional barriers rather than external obstacles.

### Intimate Scale and Personal Stakes:

Romance operates on a personal, intimate scale where the primary stakes are emotional - the potential for happiness, heartbreak, or fulfillment through connection with another person. The consequences are deeply personal rather than world-affecting.

### Focus on Connection and Understanding:

The narrative arc typically involves characters learning to understand each other, communicate effectively, and build genuine emotional intimacy. The journey is as important as the destination.

### Emotional Resolution:

Romance seeks to create emotional satisfaction through the resolution of relationship dynamics, whether through successful union, mutual understanding, or meaningful closure.

## Examples of Romance:

### 9 Songs

9 Songs exemplifies pure Romance by stripping away all external plot elements to focus solely on the relationship between two people. The film follows their connection from initial attraction through intimacy to eventual separation, with every scene serving to explore their romantic and sexual bond. The narrative structure is entirely built around the emotional arc of their relationship, making it one of the rare examples of Romance as a standalone genre.

### Before Sunrise

Before Sunrise demonstrates Romance through its focus on two strangers who meet and spend a night walking through Vienna, connecting through conversation and shared experiences. The entire film is built around the development of their emotional and intellectual intimacy, with no external plot driving the story. The romance itself - its possibility, uncertainty, and emotional impact - provides all the narrative tension and resolution.

### Blue Is the Warmest Color

Blue Is the Warmest Color presents Romance through the long-term relationship arc between two women, focusing entirely on their emotional journey together. The film explores the intensity of first love, the challenges of maintaining connection, and the pain of relationship dissolution. Every element serves to examine the romantic relationship without external conflicts driving the plot.

### Her

Her exemplifies Romance by exploring the emotional connection between a man and an AI, focusing purely on the development of their relationship. Despite the unconventional pairing, the film centers entirely on romantic feelings, emotional intimacy, and the challenges of connection. The near future aesthetic elements serve only as context for exploring pure romantic themes.

## How Romance Stands Alone:

Romance is defined by its pure focus on emotional connection, relationship dynamics, and the internal journey of characters navigating love. Unlike genres that use romance as motivation for action or as relief from other tensions, Romance places the relationship itself as the primary source of narrative drive and emotional engagement.

The plot in Romance serves to explore the emotional landscape of relationships, with themes revolving around vulnerability, intimacy, communication, and personal growth within the context of love. It prioritizes emotional authenticity and character development over external conflicts or genre conventions, emphasizing the profound impact of human connection. The intensity of emotion, the exploration of intimacy, and the focus on interpersonal dynamics define Romance, making it distinct from other genres that incorporate romantic elements as secondary features.

## The Rarity of Pure Romance:

Pure Romance is exceptionally rare in cinema because most films labeled as "romance movies" actually rely on other genres to provide their narrative structure and conflict resolution. What are commonly called romantic films are typically Romance-Comedy (When Harry Met Sally), Romance-Drama (The Notebook), Romance-Adventure (The Princess Bride), or Romance-Mystery (You've Got Mail), where external plot devices drive the story forward while romance provides emotional coloring.

This rarity exists because pure relationship dynamics, while emotionally compelling, often lack the external momentum that audiences expect from cinematic storytelling. Most filmmakers feel compelled to add comedic misunderstandings, dramatic external conflicts, mysterious obstacles, or adventurous journeys to create what they perceive as sufficient narrative drive. The result is that the romantic relationship becomes a vehicle for other genre experiences rather than the complete story itself.

True Romance requires filmmakers to trust that the internal emotional journey of two people connecting is sufficient to sustain an entire narrative - a bold artistic choice that few are willing to make. This makes genuine examples like 9 Songs, Before Sunrise, and Her particularly valuable for understanding what Romance looks like when it stands completely alone as a genre.
