# Genres

Genres represent the **narrative backbone** of media - the fundamental story structure and thematic core that drives what a piece of media is trying to communicate. Unlike aesthetics, which describe how a story is presented, genres define what kind of story is being told at its most essential level.

## The Problem with Traditional Genre Classification

Traditional genre systems fail Kaleidoscope's needs because they conflate narrative structure with presentation style. When people group Star Wars, Arrival, and Pacific Rim all under "Science Fiction," they're mixing fundamentally different story types simply because they share futuristic elements. This creates the exact thematic dissonance Kaleidoscope aims to avoid.

The root issue is that most genre definitions try to be everything to everyone, leading to:

- **Aesthetic contamination**: Media that is Space Opera gets called Sci-Fi when it narratively could be Fantasy in space with Space Opera aesthetic traits
- **Vague boundaries**: No clear understanding of what makes Horror distinct from Thriller
- **Sub-genre sprawl**: Endless hyphenated categories that obscure rather than clarify

## The Kaleidoscope Approach

Each genre in Kaleidoscope is defined by its **core narrative purpose** - the specific emotional and thematic experience it creates, stripped of all aesthetic dressing. A Western and a Samurai film can share the same genre (Action) while differing completely in aesthetic presentation.

This separation allows Kaleidoscope's prisms to make intelligent transitions based on narrative continuity rather than surface similarities. The result is streams that flow thematically even when jumping between different visual styles, time periods, or cultural contexts.

Genres can combine - and when they do, they create new thematic territories that are greater than their individual parts. Horror + Sci-Fi doesn't just add fear to technology; it explores the specific terror of technological hubris and ethical boundaries crossed.
