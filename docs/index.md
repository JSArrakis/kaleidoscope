# Kaleidoscope

## Overview

Kaleidoscope is a desktop media streaming assistant built to recreate the experience of a curated broadcast channel using the user’s own media library with the main goal of creating an always-on continuous stream either based on a set of rules for procedural selection or specifically designated and scheduled media in the form of adhoc one off selections or patterned reoccuring media blocks reminiscient of Tv Programming Blocks such as Fox Kids, Toonami, Nick Jr., UPN Afternoon, SNICK etc.

## The core problem

Modern personal media libraries are vast and diverse, but this abundance often works against the viewer. Random playback tends to feel disjointed and unsatisfying, while manual browsing can lead to choice paralysis—especially when someone only has a vague sense of what they want to watch. The result is wasted time, indecision, and a tendency to fall back on the same familiar titles.

In contrast, television in the 90s and 2000s offered a very different experience. With limited options at any given time, viewers simply accepted what was 'on'. This structure - programming blocks, scheduled rotations, and the lack of constant choice - often led to surprising discoveries and a more relaxed kind of enjoyment. Paradoxically, less control created more satisfaction by removing the burden of endless decision-making.

Kaleidoscope brings that dynamic into the modern era. Instead of leaving users adrift in their own collections, it acts as a personal channel that is always on, filled entirely with the media they already love. By removing some of the on-demand control, Kaleidoscope reduces choice paralysis while still offering variety. Procedural selection ensures streams feel cohesive, while scheduled programming blocks recreate the rhythm of broadcast TV—breaking up marathons and nudging viewers into content they might not have picked themselves.

The result is a continuous, context-aware stream that transforms a disconnected media library into a meaningful, curated experience: familiar yet surprising, personal yet structured.

## Smart Procedural Curation for a Continuous Stream

Kaleidoscope builds its streams by 'walking' the viewer through their library in a way that feels natural and intentional. Instead of abrupt jumps, the system uses taxonomies to gradually transition between genres, aesthetics, tones, and even target age groups. A all-ages cartoon block  might ease into an family-friendly movie, which in turn flows toward more mature programming or back again later in the schedule. This creates an arc to the channel that mirrors the rhythms of real broadcast programming, balancing variety with cohesion.

To anchor this flow in a recognizable structure, feature media such as movies or full episodes are aligned to start on the hour or half-hour, just as they did on network TV. Since most media doesn’t neatly fit into thirty-minute blocks, Kaleidoscope calculates the remaining time until the next block and fills it precisely with interludes.

These interludes consist of primarily commercials, shorts, and music videos that are sequenced to match the exact length of the gap, ensuring the channel remains continuous with no leftover or missing time. Out of the box, Kaleidoscope includes a library of default commercials in varying lengths, guaranteeing that every gap can be cleanly filled.

Thematic curation extends into these interludes as well. The first half is tailored to the feature that just ended, while the second half builds anticipation for what’s coming next. Bridging them is a short promo that recalls the iconic network idents of the 90s and 2000s. By default, this is a Kaleidoscope-branded bumper, but users can introduce their own to further personalize the experience.

This interplay of thematic “walking,” broadcast-style timing, and carefully constructed interludes is made possible by Kaleidoscope’s taxonomy system—the connective tissue that ensures every transition feels deliberate.

## How the Taxonomies fit in

As previously stated, Kaleidoscope's curated flow depends on more than just picking media at random - it relies on a custom taxonomy system to keep transitions natural and engaging. Early experiments with simple random selection revealed how jarring it could be to jump between significantly tonally different media meant for different audiences or moods. Traditional genre labels weren’t enough to solve this problem, since many works that share a genre can feel wildly different in tone, style, or intended audience.

To address this, Kaleidoscope classifies media along multiple dimensions - not just genre, but also aesthetics, age group, era, special categories, holidays, and even musical genres for music videos. These overlapping lenses make it possible to 'walk' viewers through their collection in a way that avoids thematic dissonance while still offering variety. A film’s narrative structure, its visual and tonal presentation, the audience it’s meant for, and even the era in which it was created all contribute to how it fits into a larger stream.

By combining these taxonomies, Kaleidoscope can schedule media side by side in ways that feel coherent without being repetitive. A fantasy adventure series might flow naturally into an animated movie with a similar mythic tone, which then eases into family programming before shifting into darker fare later in the schedule. The result is a channel that feels alive and thoughtfully curated, rather than a random shuffle of disconnected files.
